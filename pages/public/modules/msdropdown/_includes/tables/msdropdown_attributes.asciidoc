|`autofocus`
|As the name suggests, this attribute lets you choose that a form control
should have autofocus when the page is loaded. Only one element can have
autofocus.

|`disabled`
|If this property is enabled, you won't be able to interact with the
element.

|`form`
|It returns the name of the <form> element to associate the <select>
with. This is readonly property.

|`name`
|It returns the name of the <select> element.

|`required`
|A Boolean attribute indicating that an option with a non-empty string
value must be selected. Here is a surprise; you can change the default
message too. Just set the
`data-error-message="Your custom message here"` in `<select>`.
