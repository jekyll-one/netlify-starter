|`data-show-icon`
|If you are in need to hide the icon on the header. The default value
is: `true`

|`data-event`
|To interact msDropdown with an event. The default value is: `click`

|`data-child-width`
|Sometimes you need a list of children bigger than the dropdown. This can
help. The default value is: `null` or whatever is defined in the CSS.

|`data-child-height`
|By default, it shows all the options listed in the dropdown. If you
need to show some rows you can use this attribute. The default value is:
`null`

|`data-enable-checkbox`
|If you enable this; multiple will automatically set to true. It shows a
checkbox with each list item. The default value is: `false`

|`data-checkbox-name-suffix`
|If the checkbox is enabled; there is an extra field will be posted
with the form. Say <select> name is "tech" and checkbox is enabled,
tech_mscheck[] will be posted as an array. The default value is:
`{select_name}_mscheck`

|`data-enable-auto-filter`
|It lets you search by typing any key when msDropdown is open. Just like
auto-suggest. The default value is: `true`

|`data-visible-rows`
|If you set this attribute, it calculates the max height of the items
and sets the child height based on the number provided in value. You can
also achieve this by using the data-child-height property, only that set
in pixels. The default value is: `null`

|`data-show-plus-item-counter`
|If multiple is true and you select more than one item; it shows a text

what? You can change that by setting this attribute. The default value
