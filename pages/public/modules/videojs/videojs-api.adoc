The J1 Template support playing video on web pages, the new standard of HTML5
to show videos on webpages natively.

HTML5 Video opens the doors to your way of presenting video content. All
modern browsers support the tag `<video>` for playing videos. Browsers have
a built-in multimedia framework already for decoding and displaying video
content. No need to use such proprietary software components anymore.

The VideoJS library is an Open Source JavaScript framework for building HTML5
based video players on the web. It provides a customizable and extensible
platform for embedding and controlling video playback within web applications.

Key features and benefits:

Compatibility::
The library is designed to work seamlessly across different web browsers,
ensuring that a wide audience can view your videos.

Skins::
It is easy to customize the appearance of the video player by changing the
player skin and applying CSS styles to match the look and feel of your website
or application.

Plugins::
The API provides a robust plugin system that allows developers to extend its
functionality. Many plugins contributed by the community are available to add
features like captions, analytics, or advertising.

Accessibility::
The framework is built with accessibility in mind. VideoJS is making it
possible to create video players compliant with web accessibility standards,
such as providing support for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

Responsiveness::
The Player provided can be configured to automatically adapt to different
screen sizes and orientations, making it suitable for mobile and desktop
devices.

HTML5 video::
The framework leverages HTML5 video capabilities, allowing you to play
videos without relying on external plugins like _Flash_.

Streaming::
The frameowek can be used to stream video conten. This includes progressive
download and adaptive streaming technologies like HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)
and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH).

Community and Documentation::
The API has an active and supportive community of developers. It also
provides extensive documentation and examples to help developers get started
and troubleshoot any issues.

VideoJS is a powerful and versatile tool for integrating video playback
into web applications and websites, offering a high degree of flexibility
and customization. It has gained popularity due to its ease of use and robust
feature set, making it a popular choice for developers looking to incorporate
video content on the web.


[role="mt-5"]
== Options Reference
// See: https://videojs.com/guides/options/

The VideoJS system provides comprehensive documentation on its website,
which includes detailed information on the available options and
configurations.

[role="mt-5"]
=== HTML5 Video Options

[role="mb-4"]
Each of these options on the HTML video element `video` is also available
as a guide for all available attributes for the HTML5 standard
link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#Attributes[HTML5 Video Element, {browser-window--new}].
So, they can be defined in all three manners as outlined in the
link:https://videojs.com/guides/options/[VideoJS Setup Guide, {browser-window--new}].

[NOTE]
====
Typically, defaults are not listed as this is left to browser vendors.
====

[role="mt-5"]
==== autoplay

Instead of using the `autoplay` attribute you should pass an `autoplay`
option to the `videojs` function. The following values are valid:

* a boolean *false* value `false` -- the same as having no attribute on the
  video element, won't `autoplay`
* a boolean *true* value `true` -- the same as having attribute on the video
  element, will use browsers `autoplay`
* a muted string value of *muted* -- will mute the video element and then
  manually call `play()` on `loadstart`. This is likely to work.
* a string value *play* -- will call `play()` on `loadstart`, similar
  to browsers `autoplay`
* a string value of *any* -- will call `play()` on `loadstart` and if
  the promise is rejected it will mute the video element then call `play()`.

To pass the option:

[source, js]
----
var player = videojs('my-video', {
  autoplay: 'muted'
});
// or
player.autoplay('muted');
----

[NOTE]
====
The autoplay attribute and option are *not* a guarantee that your video
will autoplay. Note, if there is an attribute on the media element the
option will be ignored.
====

More info on autoplay support and changes, see the VideoJS blog post at
link:https://videojs.com/blog/autoplay-best-practices-with-video-js/[Autoplay Best Practices, {browser-window--new}].

[WARNING]
====
You cannot pass a string value in the attribute, you must pass it in the
*VideoJS options*.

Suggests to the browser whether or not the video data should begin
downloading as soon as the video element `<video>` is loaded.
Supported values are:

[cols="3a,9a", width="100%", options="header", role="rtable mt-4"]
|===

|`auto`
|Start loading the video immediately (if the browser supports it).
Some mobile devices will *not preload* the video in order to protect
their users' bandwidth/data usage. +

This is why the value is called *auto* and not something more conclusive
like the rue value `true`. +

Tip: This tends to be the most common and recommended value as it
allows the browser to choose the best behavior.

|`metadata`
|Load only the meta data of the video, which includes information like
the duration and dimensions of the video. Sometimes, the meta data will
be loaded by downloading a few frames of video.

|`none`
|Don't preload any data. The browser will wait until the user hits "play"
to begin downloading.

Each option is *undefined`* by default unless otherwise specified.

[role="mt-4"]
==== aspectRatio

Puts the player in link:https://videojs.com/guides/options/#fluid[fluid, {browser-window--new}]
mode and the value is used when calculating the dynamic size of the player.
The value should represent a ratio - two numbers separated by a colon (e.g.
`"16:9"` or `"4:3"`).

Alternatively, the *vjs-* classes `vjs-16-9`, `vjs-9-16`, `vjs-4-3` or
`vjs-1-1` can be added to the player.

|===

[role="mt-4"]
==== audioOnlyMode

If set audioOnlyMode to true, it asynchronously hides all player components
except the control bar, as well as any specific controls that are needed
only for video. This option can be set to *true* or *false* by calling the
audioOnlyMode method `audioOnlyMode([true|false])` at runtime. When used
as a setter, it returns a *Promise*. When used as a getter, it returns a
*Boolean*.

[cols="4a,8a", width="100%", options="header", role="rtable mt-4 mb-5"]
|===
|Type |Default

|`boolean`
|`false`

|===

[role="mt-4"]
==== audioPosterMode

If set audioPosterMode to true, it enables the poster viewer experience by
hiding the video element and displaying the poster image persistently. This
option can be set to *true* or *false* by calling  the *audioPosterMode*
method `audioPosterMode([true|false])` at runtime.

[cols="4a,8a", width="100%", options="header", role="rtable mt-4 mb-5"]
|===
|Type |Default

|===

[role="mt-4"]
==== autoSetup

Prevents the player from running the autoSetup for media elements with the
*data-setup* attribute.

[NOTE]
====
This option must be set globally with `videojs.options.autoSetup = false`
in the same tick as videojs source is loaded to take effect.
====

[cols="4a,8a", width="100%", options="header", role="rtable mt-4"]

|no defaults

|===

[role="mt-4"]
==== breakpoints

When used with the link:https://videojs.com/guides/options/#responsive[responsive, {browser-window--new}]
option,  sets breakpoints that will configure how class names are toggled
on the player to adjust the UI based on the player's dimensions.

By default, the breakpoints are:

.Default Breakpoints
[cols="4a,8a", width="100%", options="header", role="rtable mt-4"]
|===
|Class Name |Width Range

|`vjs-layout-tiny`
|0-210

|`vjs-layout-x-small`
|211-320

|`vjs-layout-small`
|321-425

|`vjs-layout-medium`
|426-768

|`vjs-layout-large`
|769-1440

|`vjs-layout-x-large`
|1441-2560

|`vjs-layout-huge`
|2561+

|===

While the class names cannot be changed, the width ranges can be
configured via an object like this:

[source, js]
----
breakpoints: {
  tiny: 300,
  xsmall: 400,
  small: 500,
  medium: 600,
  large: 700,
  xlarge: 800,
  huge: 900
}
----

* The _keys_ of the *breakpoints* object are derived from the associated
  class names by removing the *vjs-layout-* prefix and any `-` characters.
* The _values_ of the *breakpoints* object define the max width for a
  range.
* Not all keys need to be defined. You can easily override a single
  breakpoint by passing an object with one key/value pair! Customized
  breakpoints will be merged with default breakpoints when the player is
  created.

When the player's size changes, the merged breakpoints will be inspected
in the size order until a matching breakpoint is found.

That breakpoint's associated class name will be added as a class to the
player. The previous breakpoint's class will be removed.

See the file *sandbox/responsive.html.example* for an example of a responsive
player using the default breakpoints.

==== disablePictureInPicture

If disablePictureInPicture is set to *true*, switching the video element
into picture-in-picture is disabled. The default value is *false*.

This has no effect on Firefox, which implements a proprietary
picture-in-picture mode which does not implement the standard
picture-in-picture API.

This does not disable the document picture-in-picture mode which allows
the player element to put into a PiP window.

If enableDocumentPictureInPicture is set to *true*, the
link:https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/document-picture-in-picture/[documentPictureInPicture API, {browser-window--new}]
will be used for picture-in-picture, if available. Defaults to
*false*, but may default to *true* when the feature has become
established.

Currently this is available in Chrome 111+ as an origin trial.

This is a different picture-in-picture mode than has previously been
available, where the entire player element is windowed rather than just
the video itself. Since there are scenarios where it would be desirable
to allow PiP on the player but not PiP on the video alone (such as ads,
overlays), the *disablePictureInPicture* option *only* disables the
old-style picture-in-picture mode on the video.

==== experimentalSvgIcons [.badge .rounded-pill .bg-danger]#v8.5.0#

If set *experimentalSvgIcons* to *true*, the icons used throughout the player
from link:https://github.com/videojs/font[videojs/font, {browser-window--new}]
will be replaced by SVGs stored in VideoJS. Defaults to *false*, but may
default to *true* when the feature has become established.

These SVGs were downloaded from link:https://fontawesome.com/icons[Font Awesome, {browser-window--new}]
and link:https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/[Google's Material UI, {browser-window--new}].

You can view all of the icons available by renaming
link:https://github.com/videojs/video.js/blob/main/sandbox/svg-icons.html.example[sandbox svg-icons example, {browser-window--new}]
to *sandbox/svg-icons.html*, building VideoJS with the *npm run build* command,
and opening *sandbox/svg-icons.html* in your browser of choice.

Icons are expected to be added to a *component* inside of the player
using the link:https://videojs.com/guides/components/#adding-a-component[setIcon, {browser-window--new}]
method when customizing the player.

When *fluid* is set to *true*, the VideoJS player will have a fluid size.
In other words, it will scale to fit its container at the video's intrinsic
aspect ratio, or at a specified
link:https://videojs.com/guides/options/#aspectRatio[aspectRatio, {browser-window--new}].

Also, if the video tag `<video>` element has the class *vjs-fluid*, this

VideoJS indicates that the user is interacting with the player by way
of the classes *vjs-user-active* and *vjs-user-inactive* and the
event *useractive*.

The attribute *inactivityTimeout* determines how many milliseconds of
inactivity is required before declaring the user inactive. A value of *0*
indicates that there is no *inactivityTimeout* and the user will never be
considered *inactive*.

  indicating if you are at the live edge or not.

Without this option the progress bar will be hidden and in its place
will be text that indicates a *LIVE* playback. There will be no progress
control and you will not be able click the text to seek to the live
edge.

==== noUITitleAttributes

Control whether UI elements have a *title* attribute. A *title*
attribute is shown on mouse hover, which can be helpful for usability,
but has drawbacks for accessibility. Setting the attribute *noUITitleAttributes*
to *true* prevents the *title* attribute from being added to UI elements,
allowing for more accessible tooltips to be added to controls by a
plugin or external framework.

==== playbackRates

An array of numbers strictly greater than 0, where 1 means regular speed
(100%), 0.5 means half-speed (50%), 2 means double-speed (200%), etc. If
specified, VideoJS displays a control (of the class *vjs-playback-rate*
`vjs-playback-rate`) allowing the user to choose playback speed from among
the array of choices. The choices are presented in the specified order from
bottom to top.

For example:

[source, js]
----
videojs('my-player', {
  playbackRates: [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]
});

==== plugins

This supports having plugins be initialized automatically with custom
options when the player is initialized - rather than requiring you to
initialize them manually.

[source, js]
----
videojs('my-player', {
  plugins: {
    foo: {bar: true},
    boo: {baz: false}
  }
});
----

The above is roughly equivalent to:

[source, js]
----
var player = videojs('my-player');

player.foo({bar: true});
player.boo({baz: false});
----

[NOTE]
====
Although, since the *plugins* option is an object, the order of initialization
is not guaranteed!

==== sources

An array of objects that mirror the native video element's `<video>`
capability to have a series of child source elements `<source>`. This
should be an array of objects with the *src* and *type* properties.

For example:

----
videojs('my-player', {
  sources: [{

    type: 'video/mp4'
  }, {
    src: '//path/to/video.webm',
    type: 'video/webm'
  }]
});
----

===== click

Control *click* how clicking on the player (tech) operates. If the *click*
action is set to *false*, clicking is disabled and will no longer cause the
player to toggle between paused and playing. If controls are disabled by
setting controls to *false* `controls: false`, this will not call the
handler function.

[source, js]
----
videojs('my-player', {
  userActions: {
    click: false
  }
});
----

If the action *click* is undefined or set to *true*, clicking is enabled and
toggles the player between paused and play. To override the default click
handling, set the  action *click* to a function which accepts a *click* event.
In the following example, it will request Full Screen, the same as a the
*doubleClick* event.

If undefined or set to *true*, double-clicking is enabled and toggles
fullscreen mode. To override the default double-click handling, set
*doubleClick* to a function which accepts a *dblclick* event.

[source, js]
----
function myDoubleClickHandler(event) = {

Control *hotkeys* how the player-wide hotkeys operate. If the *hotkeys* actions
are set to *false*, or *undefined*, hotkeys are disabled. If is set to *true*
or an object -- to allow definitions of *fullscreenKey* -- hotkeys are enabled
as described below.

To override the default hotkey handling, set *hotkeys* to a function which
accepts a *keydown* event. If controls are disabled ba setting controls to
*false* `controls: false`, this will not call the related handler function.

[source, js]
----
var player = videojs('my-player', {

       this.pause();
      }
      // `y` key = play
      if (event.which === 89) {
       this.play();
     }
   }
 }

=== Component Options

The VideoJS player is a component. Like all components, you can define
what children it includes, what order they appear in, and what options
are passed to them.

This is meant to be a quick reference; so, for more detailed information
on components in VideoJS, check out the
link:https://videojs.com/guides/components[Components Guide, {browser-window--new}].

[role="mt-4"]
==== Component children

If an *Array* -- which is the default -- this is used to determine which
children (by component name) and in which order they are created on a
player (or other component).

[source, js]
----
// The following code creates a player with ONLY bigPlayButton and
// controlBar child components.
videojs('my-player', {
  children: [
    'bigPlayButton',
    'controlBar'
  ]
});
----

The *children* options can also be passed as an *object*. In this case,
it is used to provide *options* for any/all children, including
disabling them with *false*.

[source, js]
----
// This player's ONLY child will be the controlBar. Clearly, this is not the
// ideal method for disabling a grandchild!
videojs('my-player', {
  children: {
    controlBar: {
      fullscreenToggle: false
    }
  }
});

[role="mt-4"]
[[componentName]]
==== ${componentName}

Components can be given custom options via the _lower-camel-case variant
of the component name_ (e.g. *controlBar* for *ControlBar*). These can
be nested in a representation of grandchild relationships. For example,
to disable the fullscreen control:

[source, js]
----
videojs('my-player', {
  controlBar: {
    fullscreenToggle: false
  }
});

[role="mt-5"]
=== Tech Options

In VideoJS, a *tech* is a key component responsible for handling media
playback. The tech is an *abstraction layer* between the player and the
underlying technology for playing a video. It allows the framwork to support
various video technologies -- for example HTML5 video, YouTube Video,
Vimeo video, HLS, or DASH. Users of VideoJS does not need to worry about
the specific implementation details of each technology.

[NOTE]
====
The J1 Template system provides several plugins that implements *Tech*
plugins to be used for playing videos:

* _YouTube_ Video platform
* _Dailymotion_ Video platform
* _Wistia_ Video platform
* _Vimeo_ Video platform
====

A *tech* for the VideoJS framework typically consists of *JavaScript code*
that provides a common API for controlling and interacting with the video
element, regardless of the underlying technology.

This abstraction layer simplifies the process of building and customizing
video *players*, as developers can work with a consistent interface no matter
what playback technology -- YouTube for example -- is being used.

[role="mt-4"]
[[techName]]
==== ${techName}

For VideoJS, playback technologies can be given as custom options as a part
of the options passed to the *videojs* function or the video HTML element
`video`. They should be passed under the *lower-case* variant of a tech name
like *html5*.

Example:

[source, html, role="noclip"]
----
<video
  id="videojs_id"
  class="video-js vjs-theme-city"
  controls
  width="640" height="360"
