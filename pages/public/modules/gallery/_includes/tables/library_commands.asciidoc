|Command |Description

|`norewind`
|Call again justified gallery, but only the newest images
will be justified. This command could be used for example with the
infinite scroll. Remember that
with norewind only the last images will be analyzed, so this means that
any filter, sort or shuffle actions will only be done on the last
entries. That is a great advantage in terms of performances, but pay
attention in case you want a different behaviour.

|`destroy`
|Destroy the justified gallery instance. The images
justification will be cleared.
