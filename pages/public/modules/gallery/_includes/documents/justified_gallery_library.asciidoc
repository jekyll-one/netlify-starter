== Library Features

A common problem, for people who create sites, is to create an elegant image
gallery that manages the various sizes and aspect ratio of images. Flickr and
Google+ manage this situation in an excellent way, the purpose of this plugin
is to give you the power of these solutions, with a new fast algorithm.

=== Initialization

The first step of initialization is to load the CSS data.

==== CSS load

[start=1]
. The CSS data for Lightbox is included by the `CSS loader` component
  of J1Template at the top of every page within the `<HEAD>` section:

.Include the CSS
[source, html]
----
<!-- Styles for J1 JustifiedGallery -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/themes/j1/justified_gallery/css/justifiedGallery.min.css">
----

==== JS load

As a second step the JavaScript gets loaded. The plugin only needs JQuery.
Then you have only to include the JS portion of Justified  Gallery's files
as the following:

[start=2]
. The Javascript portion of Lightbox is included by the `JS loader`
  component at the bottom of a page, before the closing `</HTML>` tag:

.Include the Javascript
[source, html]
----
<!-- JS components for J1 JustifiedGallery -->
<script src="/assets/themes/j1/justified_gallery/js/justifiedGallery.min.js"></script>
----

==== HTML Markup

Justified Gallery accepts a standard format for a gallery: a series of links
with a thumbnail inside, where each link leads to the original image.

[source, html]
----
<div id="my-gallery" >
  <a href="path/to/myimage1_original.jpg">
    <img alt="Title 1" src="path/to/myimage1_thumbnail.jpg"/>
  </a>
  <a href="path/to/myimage2_original.jpg">
    <img alt="Title 2" src="path/to/myimage2_thumbnail.jpg"/>
  </a>
  <!-- other images... -->
</div>
----

==== JS initialization

Now, you only need to call the plugin that will justify all the images,
with the default options.

[source, js]
----
$("#my-gallery").JustifiedGallery();
----
