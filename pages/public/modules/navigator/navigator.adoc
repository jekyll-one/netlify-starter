When it comes to the usability of a website the focus of your vistors is
on one important component: The Navigation System of the site. The Navigation
System used by J1 Theme (the Nagigator Module) is using a modified version
of _Bootsnav_, a multi purpose navigation builder based on the _Bootstrap_
Framework.

_Bootsnav_ extends the native navigation features of _Bootstrap_ by more
complex functionalities and additional features. J1 Theme integrates
_Bootsnav_ into the world of _Jekyll_, and make all features available by
*configuration*. No programming is needed.

[NOTE]
====
Since J1 Theme has been moved to the most current version of _Bootstrap_
(BS) *V5* The underlying Javascript and CSS components of _Bootsnav_ have
been heavily *modified*. The original implementation of _Bootsnav_, created
by *Adam M Nurdin* link:{url-bootsnav--github}[can be found here, {browser-window--new}],
was based on the BS Framework of version *V3*.

The basic concepts remain unchanged but a lot of changes were made to make
the library usable for J1 Theme based on _Bootstrap_ V5.
====

_Bootstnav_ improves the _Bootstrap_ Framework in regard to ease-of-use
and a powerful, simplified navigation. This is achieved by providing a
Navigation Bar (the Navigator) which features a *MainMenu*, an area for
*Quicklinks* and, as collapsible components, the *Topsearch* element.

/////
There are plenty of layout flavours to be chosen from for an individual
arrangement of these elements. As of today 20+ variations are available to
navigate a site using _Bootstrap_ with _Bootsnav_.
/////

No doubt, content counts. A well-structured navigation system leads to an
excellent browsing experience for your visitors by offering easy access,
fast orientation and quick overviews.
