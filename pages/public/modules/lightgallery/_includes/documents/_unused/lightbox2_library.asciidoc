== Lightbox V2 API

The current major version for Lightbox used by J1Template is version 2.9.0
for jQuery. Lightbox is fully integrated with the template system. The module
is enabled by default and automatically loaded and initialized. Lightbox is
controlled by it's configuration (file) `j1_lightbox.yml`, located
under `_data/modules`.

=== Initialization

The initialization of Lightbox is done by *J1Template* in a 4-step-sequence.
By default,`Lightbox` is *enabled* and initialized *automatically*.

==== CSS load

The first step of initialization is to load the CSS data.

[start=1]
. The CSS data for Lightbox is included by the `CSS loader` component
  of J1Template at the top of every page within the `<HEAD>` section:

.Include the CSS
[source, html]
----
<!-- Styles for J1 LightBox -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/themes/j1/Lightbox V2/css/lightbox.min.css">
----

==== JS load

As a second step the JavaScript gets loaded. Lightbox uses lightbox.js
(lightbox.min.js for the minified version).

[start=2]
. The Javascript portion of Lightbox is included by the `JS loader`
  component at the bottom of a page, before the closing `</HTML>` tag:

.Include the Javascript
[source, html]
----
<!-- JS components for J1 LightBox -->
<script src="/assets/themes/j1/Lightbox V2/js/lightbox.min.js"></script>
----

==== HTML Markup

To enable `Lightbox` on images, a trigger `event` is needed as well as
`data attributes` to hook in and control the `Lightbox` library.

To use Lightbox with image data, images are linked by HTML `anchor` elements.
The anchor element `<a> .. </a>` enables on-click events and allows to place
`data attributes` to hook in the library and pass data to the software.

.Anchor element to enable Lightbox for an image
[source, html]
----
<a href="</path/to/image>" data-lightbox="<value>" data-title="<title>"></a>
----

The on-click `event` triggers the `jQuery` system and the data attribute
`data-lightbox` binds (hooks) this event to `Lightbox`, pass data `values`
to process the `image` data referenced by the parameter `href` of the anchor
element.

==== JS initialization

[start=3]
. Finally, the Lightbox library is being initialized by the `JS Initializer`
  component on the `document-ready` event.

.Initialize the Javascript portion of Lightbox
[source, html]
----
<!-- ++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- Load J1 Initializers -->
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- Enable Initializer for J1 LightBox -->
  <script type="text/javascript"
    src="/assets/themes/j1/j1/js/initializers/j1_lightbox.js">
  </script>
    ...
    ...
<!-- Run J1 Initializers on DocumentReady Event -->
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
  <script type="text/javascript">
  $(document).ready(function() {

<!-- J1 Lightbox -->
<!-- Initialize the Lightbox -->
    J1Lightbox.init();
    ...
    ...
  });
  </script>
----

=== Options

The `Lightbox` library supports several options to control how images are
displayed in size, offer parameters to change e.g. the animation or
the placement of images.

If you want to change any of the default options, the `option` method can
be used to set individual values to change the behaviour of `Lightbox`. To
change any of the (default) options, the (Javascript) `lightbox` object
provides the method `option` to set individual values.

[source, html]
----
<script>
  lightbox.option({
    resizeDuration: 200,
    wrapAround:     true
  })
</script>
----

Find with the following all options available with `Lightbox` to change
the behaviour of the module for your specific needs.

[cols="^3a,^2a,^5a", options="header", width="100%", role="rtable mt-3"]
|===
|Option |Default |Description

|`alwaysShowNavOnTouchDevices`
|false
|If `true`, the left and right navigation arrows which appear on mouse hover
when viewing image sets will always be visible on devices which support
touch.

|`albumLabel`
|Image %1 of %2
|The text displayed below the caption when viewing an image set. The default
text shows the current image number and the total number of images in the set.

|`disableScrolling`
|false
|If `true`, prevent the page from scrolling while Lightbox is open. This
works by settings overflow hidden on the body.

|`fadeDuration`
|600
|The time it takes for the Lightbox container and overlay to fade in and
out, in milliseconds.

|`fitImagesInViewport`
|true
|If `true`, resize images that would extend outside of the viewport so
they fit neatly inside of it. This saves the user from having to scroll
to see the entire image.

|`imageFadeDuration`
|600
|The time it takes for the image to fade in once loaded, in milliseconds.

|`maxWidth`
|no default
|If set, the image width will be limited to this number, in pixels.

|`maxHeight`
|no default
|If set, the image height will be limited to this number, in pixels.

|`positionFromTop`
|50
|The distance from top of viewport that the Lightbox container will
appear, in pixels.

|`resizeDuration`
|700
|The time it takes for the Lightbox container to animate its width and
height when transition between different size images, in milliseconds.

|`showImageNumberLabel`
|true
|If `false`, the text indicating the current image number and the total
number of images in set (Ex. "image 2 of 4") will be hidden.

|`wrapAround`
|true
|If `true`, when a user reaches the last image in a set, the right
navigation arrow will appear and they will be to continue moving
forward which will take them back to the first image in the set.

==== Attribute `data-lightbox`

Add the `data-lightbox` attribute to *any* image link to enable Lightbox.
For the value of the attribute, use a:

* a *unique* name, e.g `data-lightbox="image-1"` for *single* images
* a *group* name, e.g `data-lightbox="image-group-1"` for a *group* of images

.Single images
[source, html]
----
<a href="image-1.jpg" data-lightbox="image-1"></a>
<a href="image-2.jpg" data-lightbox="image-2"></a>
----

If you have a *group* of related images that you would like to combine them into
a *set*, use the *same* `data-lightbox` attribute *value* for *all* images of
that group.

.Image group
[source, html]
----
<a href="image-1.jpg" data-lightbox="image-group-1"></a>
<a href="image-2.jpg" data-lightbox="image-group-1"></a>
----

==== Attribute `data-title`

Add a `data-title` attribute to the anchor element if you want to show a
caption for the image displayed by Lightbox.

The following example:
[source, html]
----
<a href="image-1.jpg" data-lightbox="roadtrip" data-title="Caption text #1">Image #1</a>
<a href="image-2.jpg" data-lightbox="roadtrip" data-title="Caption text #2">Image #2</a>
<a href="image-3.jpg" data-lightbox="roadtrip" data-title="Caption text #3">Image #3</a>
----

*groups* three images but sets individual *caption text* each picture.
