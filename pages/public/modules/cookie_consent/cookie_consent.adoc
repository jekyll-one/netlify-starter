CAUTION: This page is under construction. An updated version will be

On the 26th of May 2012, the EU government decided it was necessary for
every website available inside the EU to have to give visitors the option
to allow or disable cookies.

While most people saw this as unnecessary and a disruption to collecting
analytical data, etc, the EU law was passed. One of the EU's steps towards
ruining the internet.

But rather than simply refuse to comply and potentially face consequences
in the future, a lot of website owners and developers took the step of
implementing code on their websites to give users the option to enable or
disable cookies.
